# Dave's MVP Resource

## What does MVP stand for?
While MVP in the past has stood for a lot of different things: Most Valuable Player, Most Valuable Professional, Mitral Valve Prolapse... in this case, I mean Minimum Viable Product. So what is the point of this? Here you will find various ways to setup products in a minimally viable way. Meaning, these will probably NOT be the "right" way to do something. Will it work? Sure! Can I use it in production? I wouldn't. I will be covering topics that I am by no means an expert on and found how to make it work by trial and error... and some documentation reading.

## What's here?
This will hold a repository of information on how to install, integrate, or take advantage of various pieces of software and other digital solutions. Among the items listed will be: Setup a SQL CLuster with Always-On Availability Groups, Setup and configure Delinea Secret Server to integrate with ServiceNow ITSM, and many more (eventually)!
