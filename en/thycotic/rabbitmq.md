# RabbitMQ server for Secret Server

For this setup, start with a fresh Centos 8 install. Any version of linux will work, though the instructions will be different in the installation portion of RabbitMQ. After RabbitMQ is installed, all instructions should be the same.

## Installation
To install RabbitMQ on Centos 8, there are a few options. I will be using the instructions from the RabbitMQ site about [installing on Centos 8](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html). I will be using the [PackageCloud instructions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html#package-cloud). Since the instructions are on this site, they will not be replicated here in case procedures change. Continue to the next section after RabbitMQ is installed.

## Configuration
